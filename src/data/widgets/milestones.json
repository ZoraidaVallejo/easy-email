With more than 100 attendants, the Webinar was very informative and successful. We have already received great feedback from lawyers, and people are excited about this series's upcoming talks. As a result, we have identified an increase in sign-ups for our Connect Pro service. Thank you to all the people involved in the event. Go Justia!"
