          "Our adorable and ever-growing pup, Ziggy, celebrated his 6-month birthday on April 30th! This playful little guy loves seeking out remote controls in his free time and has already playfully demolished a couple of them! We welcomed Ziggy to our family on March 11th and recently discovered his unique heritage: 30% German Shepherd, 24% American Pit Bull Terrier, 20% American Bully, 12% American Staffordshire Terrier, 8% Rottweiler, and 6% Siberian Husky. Quite an assortment of breeds!",
