          "Mika, the Boxer, is four months old and the newest member of Arturo's Family. Laila, the Dogue de Bordeaux, is six years old, and she welcomed Mika with her paws wide open. Both like to sleep together, play tug-of-war, chase the ball, and wrestle until Laila growls because Mika bites her. But most of the time, they are just two lovely BFFs spending time together!"
