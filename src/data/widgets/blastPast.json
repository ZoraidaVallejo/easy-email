        "The Luau is one of the most popular celebrations at Justia. As in ancient times, Justia employees gather together to celebrate the Luau with a feast, costume contests, and we have lots of fun. Our colleagues put on festive hula shirts and grass skirts to celebrate the Aloha Spirit in every friendly gathering. Do not hesitate to wear a classic Hawaiian lei in our next Luau. Use your creativity and imagination to make this office party something out of this world."
