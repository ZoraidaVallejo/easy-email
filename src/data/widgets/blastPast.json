        "<i>“I needed a standing desk, so I bought the base (the tabletop was missing). I purchased tools and took an online course to learn how to use them. When I finished the tabletop, I thought, \"I'm going to use the wood left from the tabletop and see what I can do.\" That's where the idea for the coffee table came from. It took me about five months to finish it because I frequently changed the original idea. While I am not completely happy with some details, I am satisfied with the final result.”</i><br>- Diego Miguel"
