        "Justia held its 2021 Ugly Sweater contest on Monday, December 13th, at the end of our team meeting. With a higher number of participants for this edition and the addition of our furry companions, everybody had the chance to show off their sweaters. Congratulations to the winners who claimed the bragging rights to the title. Special thanks to Zoey and little helpers for the great Amazon gift card prizes."
