        "Jesus was invited to participate with a Labor Engineering Workshop at a local university (Universidad Tecnológica de Torreón, UTT). The workshop's goal was to share his working experience as a client support specialist to provide the attendees with an opportunity to approach the professional field. During the workshop, he spoke about Justia as a company, what we do, its presence in México, a bit about the company culture, and his personal experience within the company. He ended up his participation with a reflection on the extended stay in an organization."
