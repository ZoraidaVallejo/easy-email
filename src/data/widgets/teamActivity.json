With Taylor Swift's involvement, this Super Bowl promises to be one of the most unforgettable yet. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who enthusiastically participated in this year's edition. Congratulations to Jose Soto for the closest guess, Samuel Yang for the second closest guess, and Mayra for the third closest guess. Let's also acknowledge the honorable mention of Ken Chan and Rafael Peralta."
