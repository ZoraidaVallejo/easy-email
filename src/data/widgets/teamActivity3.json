        "Students and teachers from the Technical Institute of Agujita, Coahuila, visited the MX Office. We were delighted to receive students in our offices again; this is the biggest group we have ever received! We chatted about Justia, our internship program, and much more. The Justia talent initiatives are important for the development and benefit of young talent in the region."
