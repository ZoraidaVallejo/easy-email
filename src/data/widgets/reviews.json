          "<i>\"In the field of design, it is essential to attain knowledge and inspiration about different trends and tools in UX, UI, logos, photography, photo and video editing, and other related topics. Do not panic! You can learn in a self-taught way; it doesn't matter if you are a professional or a beginner. A good practice is to learn from the professional experiences that others share. I recommend reading this article about YouTube channels created by talented people as they go over different design topics and share knowledge that could help with daily work.\"</i>",
