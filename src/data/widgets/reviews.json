          "<i>\"It is one of my favorite books because it is full of pearls of wisdom. It is easy to read and includes some quite remarkable teachings about self-knowledge. The story shows how people tend to seek others' approval without considering their own well-being. Little by little, they get themselves locked down in heavy armor. Throughout the story, the readers can understand the importance of being who you are from the inside and learn that the key to defeating their biggest fears is knowing who they really are.\"</i>",
