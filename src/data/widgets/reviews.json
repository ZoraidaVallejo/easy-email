          "<i>\"The pandemic affects societyâ€™s physical and mental health. Unfortunately, it also increases other types of stress (for example, financial stress). Due to the increase of online scams, it is important to be wary and protect ourselves and avoid situations that could take a toll on us. Money, Explained is a Netflix documentary series that educates people on money and warns people about scams. The documentary is easy to follow, with simple language and graphics. My favorite episode is the second one about credit cards.\"</i><br>- Hector Lugo"
