          "<i>This documentary follows Nepalese climber Nirmal Purja, known as Nimsdai, on his attempt to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter mountains in just seven months, breaking the previous record of 7 years. This climbing endeavor, which he called “Project Possible,” shows Nimsdai pushing the limits of human endurance as he and his team traverse Mount Everest, K2, and 12 other iconic peaks through extreme weather.</i>",
          "<i>The footage is stunning, and his ambition, perseverance, and dedication are awe-inspiring. Watch what he makes possible with a powerful positive attitude!</i>",
