          "<i>\"This film unveils the harrowing true tale of the 1972 plane crash in the Andes Mountains. On board were members of the Uruguayan rugby team from the Old Christians Club of Montevideo, who bravely battled against adversity. Astonishingly, some of them endured for 72 days following the tragic incident. Their survival was a testament to their collective teamwork, leadership, problem-solving prowess, unwavering faith, perseverance, emotional intelligence, respect, and dedication to a shared objective. These survivors impart profound lessons that resonate not only with humanity but also with the business world.\"</i>",
