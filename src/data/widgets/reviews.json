          "<i>\"Command Line Heroes is a podcast that I highly recommend. In the episodes, people address a wide variety of topics such as tech history, the first OS, how open-source code was born, and BASIC's inception, among other important technology milestones. Interestingly, it includes the original audio from a variety of highly recognized tech conferences. Saron Yitbarek's narrative with sound effects is exceptional and easy to follow. I personally believe it's a great way to learn about tech history.\"</i>",
