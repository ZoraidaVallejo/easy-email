          "<i>\"This is an eye-opening book. Hans Rosling will walk you through his experiences as a physician, researcher, TED-talk presenter, health adviser for WHO and UNICEF, and more. He will help you overcome biases and see the world with a clearer and broader perspective. He will also give you good reasons to be optimistic about the future of humanity. He will not give you hope, but data and facts.\"</i>",
