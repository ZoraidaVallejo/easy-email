          "<i>Kurzgesagt means ‘In a Nutshell’ in German, and it is just animation videos explaining things with optimistic nihilism. The studio’s YouTube channel focuses on minimalist animated educational content, using the flat design style. I like it because it discusses scientific, technological, political, philosophical, and psychological subjects. Most of their videos put some really interesting things into perspective.</i>",
