          "<i>Written by an award-winning historian, this thorough but reasonably concise volume brings Ukraine out of the shadow of Russia more than most narratives. Gates of Europe captures the richness of Ukraineâ€™s history and culture, helping explain why its people fight fiercely for their freedom.</i>",
