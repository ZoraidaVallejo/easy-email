          "<i>A book that teaches us how to create or improve our productivity in our daily tasks. I highly recommend reading this book as Will Gompertz uses real examples from well-known artists. The case scenarios can be related to situations that we are currently experiencing in our daily lives. We can learn how creativity is involved in everything we do and lead us to a better way of thinking before creating something or performing a task. Adding art or creativity to everything you do will have a very positive impact on your life.</i>",
