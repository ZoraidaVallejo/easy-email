          "<i>\"The Queen's Gambit is a fictional, beautifully-shot miniseries on Netflix of an American chess prodigy girl who's on the path to becoming the best in the world. It shows how innate talent can only get you so far, and it takes hard work, discipline, and team-work to be successful. I recommend it; it's a very interesting and entertaining show.\"</i>",
