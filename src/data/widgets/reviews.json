          "<i>Project Hail Mary is Andy Weir's third novel written after 2011's The Martian and 2017's Artemis.</i>",
          "<i>The novel centers on middle school-teacher-turned-astronaut Ryland Grace, who wakes up on a spaceship with no memory. He soon learns that he is the sole survivor on a desperate mission to save the Earth.</i>",
          "<i>He starts recovering his memories slowly as he starts putting the pieces together to find out what has happened to complete his interstellar mission to save humanity. It is a fabulous story of sheer determination to survive using science and engineering against overwhelming odds.</i>",
          "<i>The author is known for conducting extensive research for the sake of scientific accuracy, so this is also a great book to learn a thing or two about physics, astrobiology, and orbital mechanics. There's already a movie in the planning with Ryan Gosling starring.</i>",
          "- Miguel Berlanga"
