          "<i>\"I recommend it since it's a great book of the school of philosophy called \"Stoicism,\" which teaches us to focus on the things we can control (like how we respond to things that happen to us) and to not worry about things we can't control (like money, social status, fame, and what others think), so we can live a better life, giving our best to the things we do without having to worry about the outcome.\"</i>",
