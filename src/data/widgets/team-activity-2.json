          "Justia attended the 2022 National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) Convention in Las Vegas. Our team spoke with the attendees about Justia's mission and the Justia Portal and provided insights about all our Justia Marketing Solutions. During the event, several lawyers claimed their free Justia Profile in the Justia Lawyer Directory and participated in a raffle for some Apple products. Undoubtedly, a great experience for Justia and an excellent opportunity to continue building Brand Awareness of our free law initiatives and our marketing solutions for lawyers and law firms."
