        "Ziggy is a 5 month old bouncy and adorable puppy! Ziggy is very clumsy - he always seems to be tripping over his own paws and bumping into things. Ziggy is always eager to play and explore and he loves chasing after his ball. Even though he may not be the most graceful pup around, his boundless energy and affectionate personality more than make up for it."
