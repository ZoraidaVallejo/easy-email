        "Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm 24 years old, and I'm from Ensenada, Baja California. I'm a Master in Computer Sciences from CICESE. I love learning about new technologies and development. Even though I'm young and inexperienced, I have a strong desire to discern how the world works. I like to think that something big is out there; that's why I wanted to join Justia. I play ping pong and volleyball in my free time. If possible, I often join local tournaments just for fun. I like to play video games such as League of Legends, Smash, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, to name a few."
