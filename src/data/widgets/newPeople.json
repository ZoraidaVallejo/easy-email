        "Hello everyone, my name is Noelia Méndez or simply Nóe, I’m 21 years old, originally from the port of Manzanillo, Colima. Just graduated from the career of Computer Systems Engineering. I have focused on the Front-End development area. I am a curious and a bit extrovert person, I don't give up easily and I hate leaving things incomplete. I love to dance, sing, laugh and enjoy every day. I am not afraid to ask for help or to provide it in whatever way I can."

        "Hi everyone, my name is Ana Aguilar. I'm 32 years old; I'm from Saltillo, Coahuila; I have been working on IT for about ten years. I have been working in different areas, from programming to managing projects and support, which has been an excellent opportunity for me to learn and improve as a professional. I enjoy reading and baking desserts in my free time; I also think spending time with the people we love and taking time for self-care is a big part of a balanced life. I look forward to starting on this new path and to work with all of you."
