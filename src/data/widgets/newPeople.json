        "I am a tech enthusiast, an Apple fan, and the father of a dog and a cat. I like to spend time with friends and family, go hiking with my dog, practice adventure sports, listen to music, read about tech news and Buddhism, and try Italian and Oriental food. I consider myself a cheerful and optimistic person with both strengths and weaknesses. One of the greatest virtues of life is helping people around you and always doing the right thing."
