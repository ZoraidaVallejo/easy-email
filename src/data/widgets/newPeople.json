        "Hi everyone! I'm David Lopez, and I come from Saltillo, Coahuila. I'm 25 years old and work as a computer systems engineer. I really believe that it's important to share knowledge rather than keeping it to ourselves. I enjoy trying out new tech stuff, cooking, watching and playing sports, and listening to music. I'm super excited about joining this team and ready to take on whatever challenges come my way!"
