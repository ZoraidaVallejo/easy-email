          "Hello there! I'm Cesar Zarate, an (almost) computer systems engineer. My coding journey began with the dream of becoming a game developer. However, as I delved deeper into the expansive realm of software development, I uncovered a passion for web development. Along the way, I've had the privilege of working with incredibly talented individuals and gaining valuable experience. I'm excited to join Justia and contribute, fostering mutual growth for us all!"
