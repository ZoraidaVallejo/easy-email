        "Hello everyone, my name is Noelia Méndez, or simply Nóe. I'm 21 years old, and I am from the port of Manzanillo, Colima. I just graduated from Computer Systems Engineering. I am focused on front-end development. I am curious and a bit of an extrovert. I don't give up too easily, and I hate leaving things incomplete. I love dancing, singing, laughing, and enjoying every day of my life. I am not afraid to ask for or give help."

I'm 32 years old, I'm from Saltillo, Coahuila, and I’ve been working on IT for about ten years in different areas: programming, project management, and support. I enjoy reading and baking in my free time. I firmly believe that spending time with the people we love and taking time for self-care is a big part of a balanced life. I look forward to starting this new journey and working with you all."
