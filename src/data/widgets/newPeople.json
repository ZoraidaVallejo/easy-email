        "Hi! I'm Rafael, I'm 24 years old, and I'm from Ensenada, Baja California. I'm a Master in Computer Sciences graduate from CICESE. I like to learn about new technologies, develop, and create. I'm young and inexperienced, and I want to know how the world works. I like to think that something big is out there; that's why I wanted to join Justia. I play ping pong and volleyball in my free time, join local tournaments just for fun, and when I can't, I like to play video games like League of Legends, Smash, Breath of the Wild, and many more."
