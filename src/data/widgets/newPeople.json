        "Hello all, my name is Kara Simon, and I am the newest member of the Editorial Team. I am based in Chicago, Illinois, but originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I have a BA in Writing and followed that with a JD after a year as a freelance writer and consultant. My newest talent is learning to boulder, and I have the blisters to prove it. I love the opportunity to try new things, and I look forward to getting to know the Justia team."

        "Hi everyone! My name is Marina Wilson. I am (almost) 28 years old, and I am from the New Orleans, Louisiana area. I have a bachelor's in Consumer Journalism from the University of Georgia and got my JD at LSU. When I am not at work, I am usually at a football game, spending time with my family and friends, or planning my next weekend adventure. I also have an English Bulldog that I love to take along for outings, though I am pretty sure she prefers napping all day. I am looking forward to meeting you all and am glad to have joined the team at Justia!"
