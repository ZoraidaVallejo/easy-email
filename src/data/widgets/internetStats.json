    "* WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)",
    "Web accessibility matters to ensure people living with disabilities have equal access to the internet and the resources it provides. Law firms should ensure they are not missing potential clients that need access to a lawyer. Further, you want to ensure your digital presence is fully accessible to avoid being the target of litigation in this active area of the law. At Justia, we run ADA compliance checks on all of our websites."
