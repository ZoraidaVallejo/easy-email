      "Google announced that Chrome browser will begin blocking web pages with mixed content beginning December 2019. Mixed content is when a secure web page (loaded through HTTPS) also contains scripts, styles, images or other linked content that is served through the insecure HTTP protocol. You may rest assured and ignore any solicitations attempting to scare you about this update - we have made sure to load all resources on your Justia websites and blogs through HTTPS."
