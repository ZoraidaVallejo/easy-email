      "Google recently updated their options for flagging a review inside the Google My Business dashboard. There are now descriptions under each of the flag options, making it easier for a business owner to see which option they should choose. The old option labeled \"hateful, violent, or innapropriate\" has been split into 3 specific labels: profanity, bullying or harassment, and discrimination and hate speech. There is also a new option to flag that there is \"personal information\" in the review."
