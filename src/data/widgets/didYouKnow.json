      "The <a href='https://support.google.com/business/answer/7213077?hl=en' target='_blank'><b>Google Posts content policy</b></a> for Google My Business (GMB) now officially prohibits “phone stuffing” (the practice of including phone numbers in your GMB posts). While many marketers were already aware that Google frequently rejects posts that include phone numbers, this policy change clarifies the official guidance. Don’t worry – you can still put your number on your profile and include a “Call now” button with your post."
