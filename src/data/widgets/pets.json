          "<i>Adamaris Betsabe, also known as Ada, is one year old; we rescued her from a litter of all-male kittens. Ada enjoys wrestling playfully with her dog brother before snuggling up. Machi (the Schnauzer) is short for \"machihue\", a Nahuatl word describing the water used to make tortillas. Jose Antonio, also known as Pepe, is Machi's son, and I rescued both of them when Pepe was just a few days old. Pepe, a unique breed, loves food and long walks. He appears twice in the photo, but don't think he is the favorite.</i>",
