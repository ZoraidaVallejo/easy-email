          "<i>Say hello to my best boy, Devo! He is 13 years old, but he's pretty spry for his old age. He's about 60 lbs and is a Puggle (Pug + Beagle) Shar-Pei mix. Mutts are the best! His name at the shelter was \"Hunter\", and in his younger days, he was a pretty good one. He is very smart and loyal and stays by my side day and night.</i>",
