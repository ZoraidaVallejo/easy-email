I recently graduated from Seattle University with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science - Data Science specialization. I am usually shy and introverted until I get comfortable. I love to sing and dance. On the creative end, I love organizing events and setting up event spaces (no budget constraints, please). I am excited to be a part of Justia and look forward to working with you all!"
