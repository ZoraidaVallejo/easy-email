        "description": "Hello! I am Antonio Gonz√°lez. I'm 19 years old and was born in Saltillo, Coahuila, but when I was 12, I moved to Zacatecas. Currently, I'm a Software Engineering student at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas. Listening to music is my favorite hobby, making me more creative and relaxed, so I use headphones 80% of the time. I watch movies, study technology-related topics, and play video games in my free time."
