        "description": "I'm Luis Gerardo Subealdea Hernandez, a 21-year-old student pursuing computer systems engineering at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. Gaming has been my thing since I was five, so you can imagine how much I love all sorts of video games and how much I love spending my free time playing them. I'm super passionate about programming. Exploring new technologies and coding my projects is an absolute blast and it keeps me hooked."
