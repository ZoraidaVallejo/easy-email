I am passionate about advertising, creativity, short stories, poetry, and the digital world. I am a huge NFL fan, and the Dallas Cowboys is my favorite team. I love almost all kinds of music, but Iron Maiden, Leonard Cohen, and heavy metal are my favorite ones. I enjoy running, drumming, and writing."
