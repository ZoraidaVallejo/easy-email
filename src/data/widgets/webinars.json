Or Is It? Multi-Jurisdictional Rules & Proposed Changes</a></b>",
          "<p>Bar license regulations, primarily governed by individual states, were established in a different era. Lawyers typically cannot practice in a state other than where they are licensed without exceptions or reciprocity, which can be cumbersome. Recently, both clients and lawyers have questioned this system, leading to a movement to amend Rule of Professional Conduct 5.5 regarding multi-jurisdictional practice and unauthorized practice of law. Speakers will provide an overview of this movement, discuss how to maximize the mobility of your bar license, address the ethical challenges related to advertising, and predict future developments. This session promises a dynamic discussion with the latest information.</p>"
