    "As 2020 came to a close, the beginning of a new year brings for Justia a ton of new projects and goals. We praise people's consistency and extraordinary efforts throughout the year to position our company for success. Starting in January, people are ready and determined to start afresh! However, as a company, we must make realistic resolutions and stick with them over time. Keep in mind we are a team, and there is nothing wrong with asking for help to reach goals. Happy New Year from the Justia Insider Team!"
