            "<i>I walked into major retail food store in ALAMEDA, CA. Self checked a 2lb back of shrimp. I needed to use the restroom. I asked the employee where is the restroom. As soon as I walked out the restroom. The speaker said \"SECURITY IMMEDIATELY\" I got freightened. Something dangerous was happening in the store. All shoppers heard it. Security approached me and an employee following me walked right behind me and said excuse me, what is in your bag? Defamation was all in front of shoppers. I asked her are you accusing me of stealing. I pulled out the Shrimp bag and showed her the receipt. I was then let go. I can't accept to live in this dark secrete and the humiliation I dealt with in front of shoppers. The whole store heard the SECURITY was on me and was confronted by an employee loudly in front of shoppers. I felt like hiding my face under sand. Falsely accused without evidence. This has caused a traumatic stress on me, I can never go back to that store I have trauma built in me for the rest of my life.</i><br>",
            "<i>- General Damages: This includes loss of reputation, shame, hurt feelings, embarrassment, and more. <br>- Punitive Damages: To ensure I am never defamed like this again. <br>- Financial awards Compensate me for the loss, anger, and frustration I have suffered as the result of a defamatory statement. To help ensure others do not defame me in the future.",
            "P.S. I have contacted corporate and they had the store manager call me to compensate me. I have refused he's offer for it was not enough to cover what I went thru. The store mgr send it to corporate to offer me more than what he can provide. He is limited to a certain amount to offer. <br>Corporate informed store manager to file a claim towards their insurance (same claim form like the slip and fall)</i>",
            "<i>A demad letter from an attorney I went thru a membership plan submitted a compensation of $50,000. The insurance responded for me to go back to the store and get the $50 store gift card.</i>",
