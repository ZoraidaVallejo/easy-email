  "description": [
    "We're back with a CLE to help demystify the ethical implications surrounding digital/online advertising for lawyers and law firms! In this 60-minute presentation, we'll cover various ethical implications of digital legal marketing used to engage current clients and reach new clients. Attendees will learn about ethical issues concerning law firm websites & blogs, local directories & reviews, lead generation & pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and social media advertising. We will discuss the ethical issues of targeting certain users with Google, Meta/Facebook and Geofencing ad services. We will examine how changes to Google Ads’ keyword matching implementation may lead to ethical issues for law firms in some jurisdictions. We will also examine the legal and ethical issues presented by fake reviews, both positive and negative, that seem to be a part of many law firms’ online directory profiles."
