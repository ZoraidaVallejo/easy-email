        "This presentation will provide an overview of AI ethical issues in the legal practice. It will cover examples of why lawyers have been sanctioned for unethical use of AI and the applicability of existing ethical obligations to the use of AI, including guidance from various state bars (FL, CA, NY, DC). It will also cover how courts have addressed lawyers' use of AI, including sample local rules on use/prohibition of AI in judicial proceedings and a thoughtful concurring opinion by an appellate judge advocating for limited judicial use of AI by judges. <a class=\"display-inlineb\" href=\"https://connect.justia.com/webinars/ai-ethics-using-artificial-intelligence-responsibly-in-legal-practice\">Register Now â€º</a>"
