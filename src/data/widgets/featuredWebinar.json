    "Join Justia and guest speaker David Wolf for a webinar presentation to help law firms promote their brands and secure more clients! In a competitive digital and traditional media environment, it seems that solo attorneys and small firms have no chance to create an impactful brand that brings in business. But with the right message, marketing partners, network, and effort, you can promote your firm and brand without breaking the bank. If you have a limited budget and the time and inclination to grow your client base, this seminar is for you."
