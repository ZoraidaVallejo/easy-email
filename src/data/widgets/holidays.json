        "Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States, which falls on the fourth Thursday of November. It is based on the colonial Pilgrims' 1621 harvest meal with the Wampanoag people. Rich in legend and symbolism, the holiday has been used as a day to reflect on the positive things in life, spend time with family and friends, watch football, and eat traditional Thanksgiving meals such as turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie."
