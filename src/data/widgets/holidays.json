        "Trick or Treat! Halloween, also known as All Hallow's Eve or All Saint's Eve, is a fun autumn festival celebrated on the night of October 31. Even when some people associate Halloween with fear, it is actually an opportunity to welcome the unknown and release negativity by bringing joy into our daily lives.",
