McGuire, a carpenter and labor union leader, came up with the idea for Labor Day to pay tribute to American workers’ contributions and achievements."

        "Often confused with Cinco de Mayo by people living in the United States, Mexico’s Independence Day is actually September 16th. The date marks the moment when Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest known as Father Hidalgo, made the first cry for independence."
