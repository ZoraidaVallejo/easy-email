      "There has been a large increase in the number of hijacked Google My Business (GMB) listings over the past couple of months. You may receive suspicious emails that \"Someone has requested ownership of My Business on Google My Business.\" Be wary of these emails, do not approve, and reject the requests. We also recommend reviewing the users on your GMB listing and keeping the number of users to a minimum. Having more users increases the likeliness that one of them could accidentally click on one of these messages and give an unauthorized party control of your business listing."
