      "You may have noticed that Google will give instant Q&A in the search results. Try searching “estate planning FAQs,” for example. While many people click to view an answer to a question, they may not be directed to your website if you do not include an internal link in the first paragraph. We recommend doing so on any FAQ pages that you post so that users may click through to your firm’s site from these results."

As an added benefit, your photo is also included in the geographical and practice area listings of the directory, and can help distinguish your profile from those of your peers who have not yet added a photo."
