      "People searching for a lawyer on the Justia Lawyer Directory may filter their search results based on a number of parameters to find a lawyer who best fits their needs. If you don't yet have a Justia Lawyer Rating, you risk getting filtered out by users looking only for highly ranked lawyers. Don't get lost in the shuffle; ask colleagues familiar with your work to write you a review! Once you have peer reviews, you will receive a Justia rating badge on your profile that you can proudly display on your website, blog or other marketing materials."

      "We recommend adding a well-written biography to your JLD profile that highlights your practice and shows off your passion for the law. While you may discuss your educational and professional experience, this section is really targeted for weaving a narrative about your entire practice so that a potential client can understand you and your law firm in a way that mere biographical facts cannot communicate."
