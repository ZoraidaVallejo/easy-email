      "Given the nearly constant volatility of Google Map Pack results, having accurate business hours on your law firm's Google Business Profile and other online listings is crucial. This ensures that clients and potential clients are well-informed about when your firm will be open, fostering trust and reliability. However, you should not change your business hours solely for the purpose of attempting to improve rankings. Posting incorrect hours could lead to risks such as having your profile suspended due to unwarranted but hard-to-prevent complaints that your hours are inaccurate, which would outweigh any potential benefits."
