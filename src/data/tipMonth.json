      "Before uploading images to your Justia website or blog, make sure to optimize them first. Image optimization can reduce the dimensions and file size of an image, so that the image and web page on which it is displayed loads faster. Displaying large images can slow the load time of your site drastically and affect your ranking with Google and other search engines. Generally if the image is over 300kb, you will want to optimize it before uploading it to your site. You may use <a href=\"https://kraken.io/web-interface\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Kraken</b></a> or other online image optimizers to assist. And as always, you are welcome to send us the image and weâ€™ll gladly optimize it for you."
