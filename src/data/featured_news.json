    "description": "Google hosted its annual I/O developer conference at Shoreline Amphitheatre, just down the road from Justia’s headquarters in Mountain View. The conference typically covers all of the new products and developments that Google will be launching in the near future, and this year was no different. Nick, one of our engineers, attended the conference, as he has done since it began in 2007, and live blogged about it this year. In his series of posts, Nick discusses Google’s announcements on a number of topics, including AMP, HTTPS, structured data, and more.",
