        "description": "A great way to extend your websiteâ€™s reach in specific cities or towns is to create locality pages that target potential clients who live in those places. Locality pages focus on how your firm can help residents of a particular geographic area with their legal questions and issues. When creating locality pages, always include information that is relevant to people looking for legal assistance and try to avoid generic information about a location. Doing so helps your site reach potential clients in surrounding areas that are less competitive but could still generate quality leads."
