            "Replies to online reviews are a form of social media, which can build a friendly and engaged reputation associated with your practice. In most cases bad reviews cannot be deleted, which means it is important to reply in a way that conveys you care and will do everything you can to make a specific situation right. Generally, we recommend responding in a courteous manner and keeping your responses short, readable, useful and genuine. It is also important to keep in mind any applicable legal ethics rules, such as those related to confidentiality, when responding. The way in which your business responds to criticism shows both your current and future clients your commitment to customer service.",
            "Obtaining new positive reviews can help move negative reviews down the page, which makes it important to remember to respond and thank your happy clients, while sharing new or relevant information about your practice whenever possible. This can build loyalty among your current clients who may defend you when they see someone else leave a negative review of your practice."
