            "We recommend adding a well-written biography to your JLD profile that highlights your practice and shows off your passion for the law. While you may discuss your educational and professional experience, this section is really targeted for weaving a narrative about your entire practice so that a potential client can understand you and your law firm in a way that mere biographical facts cannot communicate. If you need assistance logging in to update your profile, please <a href=\"mailto:support@justia.com\"><b>contact us</b></a>."
