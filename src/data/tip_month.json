            "Adding video to your website can provide potential clients with additional legal information and insights into your practice and your firm. Videos can also give your clients a glimpse of your personality. Your videos should be professional and branded, if possible, with the firmâ€™s logo, and they should include a call to action encouraging viewers to contact you. Bear in mind the attention span of an average viewer and keep your videos short and to the point. We recommend hosting your videos on a firm YouTube channel for better optimization. When you have video content ready, let us know and we can help you post it to your website and also provide you with information about posting it to YouTube and Google."
