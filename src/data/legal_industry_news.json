        "link": "http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/alleged_retweet_by_judge_doesnt_warrant_retroactive_recusal_9th_circuit_rul",
        "description": "A federal judge’s alleged retweet of a news story about a case in which he denied a motion does not warrant his retroactive recusal, according to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. At issue was both the Twitter account owner’s identity and whether the tweet itself necessitated recusal. The 9th Circuit determined that recusal was unnecessary because retweeting the news story in question did not constitute plain error requiring recusal. Further, the court held that the content retweeted on that Twitter account did not amount to improper ex parte communications, regardless of whether the judge was in fact owner of the account."
