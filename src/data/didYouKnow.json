  "description": ["If you have not posted to your Google+ page recently, you may receive a notification from Google that they will remove the page associated with your firm. In the past, Google+ was integrated with Google My Business but now these services are different entities. Thus, this change will not affect your local visibility on your Google My Business listing in any way. Your active GMB listings will remain unchanged and available on Google. If you would like to keep your Google+ page, you just need to log into it and resume using it by posting to it. If you have no plans to continue using it, you can just let Google remove it, and if your Justia website links to the Google+ page we will remove those links for you."]
