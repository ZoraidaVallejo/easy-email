      "You’ve probably received solicitation emails from third-party marketers that offer a free report on your website based on “audits” they have performed. Please note that their recommendations often include generic statements that are not based on any analysis of your website. Many report problems where there are none, or misinterpret some of the technical aspects of your website. If you have a question about a recommendation from a third party, please feel free to forward it to us to review."
