Some common malicious edits include: removing a website address, removing a phone number, changing a business name, marking a listing as \"Permanently Closed\", and adding inappropriate photos (note: this edit is done through Google Maps). We strongly recommend that you check your Google My Business listing regularly to ensure your information is correct, particularly if the listing is hosted under your account (as opposed to one that Justia controls)."]
