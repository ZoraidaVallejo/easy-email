  "description": ["For the fifth year in a row, we held Justia Online Day which is a cycle of presentations conducted by our teammates on various subjects related to web technologies, hosted at a university. With the theme \"Mining the Web\", the presentations covered a variety of online-related topics such as Web Scraping, Geolocation, Voice Search, and Image Optimization among others. Just like every year, the students and teachers enjoyed the presentations and took advantage of the opportunity to exchange ideas with our group of experienced engineers."]
