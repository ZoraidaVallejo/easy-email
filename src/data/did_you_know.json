        "Even if it’s been a few years since your initial blog training calls with us, you can always contact your account manager to schedule a blogging refresher for yourself or anyone else at your firm. If you’ve hired a summer intern or law clerk, we are happy to train them how to blog for you, too. It’s important to keep your blog updated with fresh content every month, so don’t be shy and let us know if we can assist you with getting back into the swing of things! And if you’re too busy to post to your blog yourself, let us know if you’re interested in purchasing custom content services from Justia."
