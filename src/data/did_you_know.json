      "In a recent <a href=\"https://lawyerist.com/podcast-129-business-public-access-law-tim-stanley/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>episode</b></a> of the <a href=\"https://lawyerist.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><b>Lawyerist Podcast</b></i></a>, Justia CEO Tim Stanley talks with Sam Glover and Aaron Street (of Lawyerist) about the history of FindLaw and Justia, and the history of public online access to free primary and secondary legal materials. Stanley explains that the core purpose of Justia is not just about making online law easily accessible, unhindered by firewalls and restrictive licenses, but to also to push for the highest quality of free law possible - published cases and codes with official citations that can be used by legal researchers. He describes some of the hurdles that still lie ahead and expresses optimism that through Justia's policy of openness and generosity, and similar work of others, such as Cornellâ€™s Legal Information Institute, free law will get better and better!"
