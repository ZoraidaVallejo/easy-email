      "link": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-asks-seos-if-domain-changes-result-in-loss-of-traffic/",
      "description": "John Mueller, a Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, recently asked if changing domains resulted in a loss of web traffic. SEOs responded that, by and large, a domain change will result in a temporary loss of traffic. The consensus seemed to be that even with careful planning and closely following industry best practices, it is difficult for most sites to avoid a drop in traffic at least in the short term. Some advised waiting for a ‘slow season’ to make such a change, and planning the migration meticulously."

      "description": "For the first time, Google has allowed users to suggest edits to Knowledge Panels. Previously there was no way to alter the information in Knowledge Panels, which are boxes that often show up at the top of Google search results, and that pull information from sources across the web in an automated manner. Now, users who verify that they manage the online presence of the entity to whom the Knowledge Panel pertains can submit potential changes to what appears there."
