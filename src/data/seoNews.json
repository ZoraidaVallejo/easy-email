      "description": "Starting in July 2018, Chrome will mark all sites that do not use HTTPS encryption as “not secure” in the address bar. For several years, Google has consistently pushed website owners and developers to use HTTPS to help secure browsing data. While Chrome already flags non-HTTPS pages that have form fields as “not secure,” the changes in July will apply to all non-HTTPS sites, regardless of whether they have form fields on them."
