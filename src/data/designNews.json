      "description": "Research from Google indicates that there are two signals which contribute to users satisfaction and trust when visiting a website. Website complexity and whether user expectations are met play a significant role in forming user perceptions. The study discovered that pages that were less complex were judged to be more visually attractive, and sites that matched expectations of what a certain kind of site is supposed to look like were also judged to be more pleasing and trustworthy."
