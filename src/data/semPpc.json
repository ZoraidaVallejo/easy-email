      "description": "Recently, Google announced a change so that ad campaigns can better handle lulls and spikes in daily activity. It involves allowing campaigns to spend up to twice their average daily budgets. While many advertisers have criticized this change as an undesirable loss of control in a key area of campaign management, others are asking a related question about why daily budgeting remains the sole option available on the Google AdWords platform when options such as monthly budgets and budgets that extend through the duration of a specific campaign may offer better ways to manage a variety of different campaign types. One measure that is intended to make advertisers feel better about the change involves overdelivery credits, where Google will credit back any costs of delivering over a campaign’s budget. Advertisers are able to track day-by-day overdelivery data from AdWords’ Reports section."
