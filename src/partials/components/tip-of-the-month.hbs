            <p>Getting online reviews can really boost your business. BrightLocal’s 2015 Local Consumer Review Survey shows that 92% of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of a local business. As you work with old clients and new this upcoming year, thank them for their business and encourage them to post a review on your Google My Business listing.</p>
