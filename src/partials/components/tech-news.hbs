            <p>In recent years, some companies have tried to buy viral videos within minutes or hours of them going viral in an attempt to license them for republication. This phenomenon raises important questions about copyright and the doctrine of fair use as applied to news media.</p>

            <p>Businesses should invest energy and resources not only in short-term marketing, such as PPC/advertising and social media engagement, but also in long-term marketing, including search engine optimization, original content, and communication. Long-term marketing increases quality traffic over time and helps build brand recognition and authority.</p>

This change is particularly notable because the Critic Reviews section is especially prominent on mobile devices, which is now how most people are searching Google.</p>

            <p>Stories, Instagram’s new feature that lets users create slideshows of images and videos, will vanish 24 hours after each initial share. To many, this is similar to Snapchat, an app where shared images and videos have a limited lifespan. Instagram explained that its intention was to allow users to share more moments and take away some of the pressure to only publish their best photos or videos.</p>

            <p>Facebook is aiming to minimize the “clickbait” content its users see on their news feeds in the future by changing its algorithm. Clickbait is content that attempts to draw attention via sensational titles or images to draw users to a particular web page. By changing its algorithm to avoid content of this nature, Facebook hopes to maintain the integrity of users’ news feeds, keep users happy, and ensure they spend more time on Facebook itself.</p>

Choosing the right words for your social campaigns can make all the difference in this instance, as well as encourage a higher level of engagement. Particularly worth noting is that these words can differ from one social media platform to another.</p>

            <p>The American Bar Association recently adopted a new professional misconduct rule that has drawn criticism from a number of legal ethics experts. Ronald Rotunda, a law professor at Chapman University, Fowler School of Law, argues that the new rule presents constitutional problems and constitutes a misguided “foray into political correctness.”</p>

            <p>Google is playing an increasingly important role in legal proceedings. In some jurisdictions, lawyers have an affirmative duty to use the Internet as part of efforts to exercise due diligence in attempting to locate parties and some other procedural aspects of cases. In another case, a judge found the dangers of researching potential jurors on the Internet outweighed any potential benefit in that case and therefore asked both parties to the lawsuit to agree not to search the Internet for information on the jurors.</p>
