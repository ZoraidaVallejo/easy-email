        <br/> In a per curiam opinion, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case. The Ninth Circuit erred when it held that “federal law” as interpreted by the Supreme Court “clearly” establishes that specific performance of the lower sentence that the parties had originally expected is constitutionally required.
