        <p>The Court will be back in session and start a new term on Monday, October 2, 2017. Two cases of note will be argued straight away – <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1161">Gil v. Whitford</a> and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1436">Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project</a>. The former concerns voting rights and gerrymandered districts in Wisconsin and the Court’s decision could have a wide-ranging impact on voting rights in the United States. Read more about this case here:</p><br />
        
        <p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/us/politics/justices-to-hear-major-challenge-to-partisan-gerrymandering.html?_r=0">Justices to Hear Major Challenge to Partisan Gerrymandering</a>,” New York Times, June 19, 2017.</p><br/ >
        
        <p>The second argument of note, Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project, is scheduled for hearing on Tuesday, October 10. The Government will argue its brief for the enforcement of Executive Order Nos. 13,769 (EO-1) 13,780 (EO-2) which involve the restriction of travel of nationals from seven majority Muslim countries identified by Congress or the Executive as presenting heightened terrorism-related risks.</p><br />

        <p>With issues that often evenly divide the Court along conservative and liberal lines, it is likely that Justice <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/08/swing-time">Anthony Kennedy’s vote</a> may determine the outcome of many of these cases.</p>
