                </a> (6/5/17) <br/> Ordering equitable relief in a redistricting case requires that a court consider the severity and nature of the constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that the lower court erred because it had not conducted an adequate analysis of these factors before ordering a special election.

In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that, for a state court’s decision to be an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law, the decision must be so objectively unreasonable that there is no possibility for fairminded jurists to disagree.

Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court, which held that the only relief that the Act provided for the applicant’s failure to turn over application and manufacturing information was the filing of a declaratory judgment action.
