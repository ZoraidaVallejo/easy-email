        "The Court will be back in session and start a new term on Monday, October&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2017. Two cases of note will be argued straight away – <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1161\">Gil v. Whitford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1436\">Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project</a>. The former concerns voting rights and gerrymandered districts in Wisconsin and the Court’s decision could have a wide-ranging impact on voting rights in the United States.

        "The second argument of note, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1436\">Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project</a>, is scheduled for hearing on Tuesday, October 10. The Government will argue its brief for the enforcement of Executive Order Nos. 13,769 (EO-1) 13,780 (EO-2) which involve the restriction of travel of nationals from seven majority Muslim countries identified by Congress or the Executive as presenting heightened terrorism-related risks.",
        "With issues that often evenly divide the Court along conservative and liberal lines, it is likely that Justice <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/08/swing-time\">Anthony Kennedy’s vote</a> may determine the outcome of many of these cases."
